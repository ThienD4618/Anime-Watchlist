This repository contains all deliverables for our semester-long project, focusing on creating a comprehensive database system for cataloging and rating anime series.

## Overview

As the anime content landscape continues to grow, fans face challenges in finding, tracking, and evaluating shows that fit their interests. This project aims to provide a user-friendly platform for anime enthusiasts, allowing them to search for anime, create custom watchlists, track individual episodes, and contribute ratings and reviews. Our goal is to facilitate informed viewing decisions and foster community sharing among fans.

## Features
- Search for anime series by title, genre, or rating.
- Create and manage custom watchlists.
- Track individual episodes and their statuses (watched/unwatched).
- Rate and review anime series.
- User authentication for personalized experiences.
